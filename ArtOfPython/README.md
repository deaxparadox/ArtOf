# Python

Python is the general purpose scripting language, you could write a Unix shell script or Windows batch files tasks. PYthin is simple to use offering much more structure and support for large programs than shell scripts or batches files can offer.

- Python is a *very high-level language*, it has high-level data types built in, such as flexible arrays and dictionaries.

- Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary.

- The interpreter can be used interactively, which makes it easy to experiment with features of the languages, to write throw-away programs, or to test functions during bottom-up program development.
