# Object Oriented Programming

For our code to quality as being truly *object-oriented (OO)*, through, our objects will genrally need to participate in something called an *inheritance hierarchy*.

Classes are Python's main object-oriented programming (OOP) tool.

- classes are created with a new statement: the **class**.
- they are packages of functions that use the process built-in object types.
- they are designed to created and manage new objects, and support *inheritence*--a mechanism for code customization and reuse.
