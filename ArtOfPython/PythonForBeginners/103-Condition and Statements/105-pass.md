# `pass` Statement

`pass` statement is just placeholder for code. It don't do anything.


If you place *pass* inside for loop, nothing will happend:

```py
for i in range(10):
    pass
```




If want to create empty function, you can just place *pass* in place of code inside function.

```py
def func():
    pass
```

When you run this function nothing happens.
