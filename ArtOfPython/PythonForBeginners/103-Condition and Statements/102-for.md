# `for` Loop

Python `for` loop is used  for sequential traversal i.e. It is used for iteration over an iterable like `string`, `list`, `tuple` and `dict`

Syntax:

```py
for var in iterable:
    # code block
```

Each element of iterable is assign to *var*, and for each assignment to *var*, *code block* is execute once.

Simple Example:

```py
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```

```output
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```

- `range()` function is a Sequence type, which returns an iterable.


## Control with `break`

I am going to iterator over `range(10)`, and as `i` becomes 5, i am going to break the loop.  here `i` is for variables which get asssigned the elements of iterating Sequence:

```py
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)
```

```output
0
1
2
3
4
```

## Control with `continue`

Now if i want to skip, any specific range while iterating, i can do that with continue statement. Now i am going to skip values from 3-8, including end elements:

```py
for i in range(10):
    if i >= 3 and i <=8:
        continue
    print(i)
```

```output
0
1
2
9
```



## Iterating over `list` type

This code uses a for loop to iterate over a list of strings, printing each item in the list on a new line. The loop assigns each item to the variable `i` and continues untill all items in the `list` have been processed.

```py
l = ['python', 'for', 'beginners']

for i in l:
    print(i)
```

```output
python
for
beginners
```



## Iterating over `dict` type

This code uses a for loop to iterate over a `dict` and print each key-value pair or a new line.

```py
d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}

for k in d:
    print(k, d[k])
```

```output
a 1
b 2
c 3
```

## Iterating over `string` type

Now i am going to iterate over `string`:

```py
s = "python for beginners"

for c in s:
    print(c)
```

```output
p
y
t
h
o
n
 
f
o
r
 
b
e
g
i
n
n
e
r
s
```
