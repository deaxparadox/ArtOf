# Indexing with List

## Indexing 

You have seen indexing in `string`, similarly you can use indexing to access individual element from the list:

You will use the list `a`, and access element `2`, `6` whose indexes are `1`, `5`


```py
>>> a[1]
2
>>> a[5]
6
>>> 
```

You can also access element with `negative` indexing, negative indexing start from `-1` at the end of list:

```py
>>> a[-1]
10
>>> a[-3]
8
>>> 
```
