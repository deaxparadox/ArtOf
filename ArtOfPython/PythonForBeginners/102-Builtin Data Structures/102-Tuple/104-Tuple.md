# Tuple 

Tuple is `sequence type` and `immutable` data structure. It means, it cannot be manipulated. Once created it's element cannot be change.

## Syntax and  variables

Syntax for tuple is `parenthesis ()`:

Let's create a tuple:

```py
>>> a = (1,2,3,4,5)
>>> a
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
>>> 
```




Indexing and Slicing work same in `string`, `list` and `tuple` so, go on experiment with them.
