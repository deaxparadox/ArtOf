# Indexing in String

This techinque is used to access in indiviudal character in the string, `index` start from 0.

Syntax for indexing is `[] (or square bracket)`

Let's create a simple string:

```py
>>> 
>>> a = "Hello, Python!"
>>> 
```

Let's try to access `first` character from the string:

```py
>>>
>>> a[0]
'H'
>>> 
```

As you can our first character is `H`, we have used number `0`, because indexing start from `0`.

To access `5` character, we have to use index `4`:

```py
>>> a[4]
'o'
>>> 
```

If you want to access last character you can use negative indexing, which start from `-1`:

```py
>>> a[-1]
'!'
>>> 
```

and for second last you have to index `-2`, etc.
