# Comments

Comments can be used to explain Python code. It can be used to make the code more readable.

Syntax for writing comment is `#`.

Let's write our first comment:


```py
>>> # This is comment.
```

As you can see, we wrote comments  `display message` preceded by `#`, and then `print` statement display the message in the terminal.

# `print()`

Print function is used to print the output in the terminal.

```py
>>> # using print function
>>> 
>>> print("This is python")
This is python
>>> 
```

We have first written a comment about, what we are doing here, and then we have used the *print()* function to display the string in the terminal.
