### Abstract 

Defines descriptors, summarizes the protocol, and shows how descriptors are called. Provides an example showing how object relational mappings work.

Learning about descriptors not only provides access to a larger toolset, it creates a deeper understanding of how Python works.


### Definition and introduction

In general, a descriptor is an attribute value that has one of the methods in the descriptor protocol. Those methods are `__get__()`, `__set__()`, and `__delete__()`. If any of those methods are defined for an attribute, it is said to be a descriptor.

The default behavior for attribute access is to get, set, or delete the attribute from an objectâ€™s dictionary. For instance, `a.x` has a lookup chain starting with `a.__dict__['x']`, then `type(a).__dict__['x']`, and continuing through the method resolution order of `type(a)`. If the looked-up value is an object defining one of the descriptor methods, then Python may override the default behavior and invoke the descriptor method instead. Where this occurs in the precedence chain depends on which descriptor methods were defined.


Descriptors are powerful, general purpose protocols. They are the mechanism behind properties, methods, static methods, class methods, and `super()`. They are used throughout Python itself. Descriptors simplify the underlying C code and offer a flexible set of new tools for everyday Python programs.
