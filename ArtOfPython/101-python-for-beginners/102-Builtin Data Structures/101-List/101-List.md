# List

Lists are `sequence type` and `mutable` data structure. They are used to stored data.

## Syntax 

Lists are created using `square bracket` `[]`.

## Examples 

Let's create a simple list range from 1-10:

```py
>>> a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
>>> 
>>> print(a)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
>>> 
``` 




## Concatenation

You can add 2 or more list together using concatenation:

```py
>>> a
[0, 1, 2]
>>>
>>> b
[3, 4, 5]
>>> 
>>> a + b
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> 
```

As you can see we have added `list a` and `list b` together. In this way you can multiple list together.
