# What is Ownership ?

*Ownership* is a set of rules that govern how a Rust program manages memory.

Rust manages memory through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks.

- It any of the rules are voilated, the programm won't compile.
- None of the features of ownership will slow down your program while it's running.

## Ownership Rules

- Each value in Rust has an *owner*.
- There can only be one owner at a time.
- When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

## Variables Scope.

A scope is the range within a program for which an item is valid.

```rust
let s = "hello";
```

- The variable `s` referes to string literal, where the value of the strnig is hardcoded into the text of our program.
- The variable is valid from the point at which it's declared until the end of the current *scope*.


```rust
    {                      // s is not valid here, itâ€™s not yet declared
        let s = "hello";   // s is valid from this point forward

        // do stuff with s
    }                      // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid
```

Two important points in time here:

- When `s` comes into *scope*, it valid.
- It remains valid until it goes *out of* scope.
