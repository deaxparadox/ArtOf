# Difference Between Containerization and Virutalization

Virtualization machines represent hardware-level virutalization where one operating system is download on top of a host operating system. Therefore, they are heavy and fully isolated. There is no availability for SSH or TTY, and they are fully secured.

Container represent operation system virutalization. You can download as many different operating systems in containers as applications need. Container are light and fast; however they are not fullly isolated but secured.
