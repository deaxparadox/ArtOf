# Running Deno Programs

## Hello World

Deno is a runtime for JavaScript/TypeScript which tries to be web compatible and use modern features wherever possible.

Browser compatibility means a `Hello World` program program in Deno is the same as the one you can run in the browser.

Create a file locally called `first_steps.ts` and copy and paste the code line below:

```ts
cosole.log("Welcome to Deno!")
```

Run the program:

```bash
deno run first_steps.ts
```
