# The primitives: `string`, `number`, and `boolean`

- JavaScript has three very commonly used primitives: `string`, `number` and `boolean`.
- Each has a corresponding type in TypeScript.

- `string` represents string values like `"Hello, world"`
- `number` is for numbers like `42`. JavaScript does not have a special runtime value for integers, so thereâ€™s no equivalent to `int` or `float` - everything is simply `number`
- `boolean` is for the two values `true` and `false`
