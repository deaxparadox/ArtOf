# Unary Operators

`typeof` operator is a word operator, which produces a string value naming the type of the value you give it.

```js
> console.log(typeof 4.5)
number
```

```js
> console.log(typeof "x")
string
> 
```

`typeof` takes only one value. Operators that use two values are called *binary* operators, while those that take one are called *unary* operators. The minus operator can be used both as a binary operator and as a unary operator.

```js
console.log(- (10 - 2))
-8
```
