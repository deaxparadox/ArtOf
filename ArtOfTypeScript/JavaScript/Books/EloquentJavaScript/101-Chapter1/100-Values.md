# Values

A typical modern computer has more than 30 billion bits in it volatile data storage (working memory). Nonvolatile storage (the hard disk or equivalent) tends to have yet a few orders of magnitude more.

To be able to work with such quantities of bits without getting lost, we must separate them into chunks that represent pieces of information. In a JavaScript environment, those chunks are called *values*.

Every value has a type that determines its role. Some values are numbers, some values are pieces of text, some values are functions, and so on.
