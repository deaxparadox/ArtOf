# any

TypeScript also has a special type, `any`, that you can use whenever you don’t want a particular value to cause typechecking errors.

```ts
let obj: any = { x: 0 };
// None of the following lines of code will throw compiler errors.
// Using `any` disables all further type checking, and it is assumed 
// you know the environment better than TypeScript.
obj.foo();
obj();
obj.bar = 100;
obj = "hello";
const n: number = obj;
```

## `noImplicitAny`

When you don't specify a type, and TypeScript can't infer it from context, the compiler will typically default to `any`.

You usually want to avoid this, though, because `any` isn’t type-checked. Use the compiler flag `noImplicitAny` to flag any implicit `any` as an error.
