# The OSI Reference Model

- OSI model paves the way for the data transfer between disparate hosts running different operating systems, like Unix hosts, Windows machines, Macs, Smartphones, and so on.

- The OSI is a logical model, not a physical one. It's essentially a set of guidelines that developers can use to create and implement applications to run on a network. It also provides a framework for creating and implementing networking standards, devices, and internetworking schemes.

- The OSI has seven different layers, divided into two groups. The top three layers define how the applications within the end stations will communicate with each other as well as with users. The bottom four layers define how data is transmitted end to end.
