# The Application Layer

The *Application layer* of the OSI models mark the spot where users actually communicate to the computer and comes into play only when it's clear the access to the network will be needed soon.

The Application layer is working as the interface between the actual application program and the next layer down by providing ways for the application to send information down through the protocol stack. This  isn’t actually part of the layered structure, because browsers don’t live in the Application layer, but they interface with it as well as the relevant protocols when asked to access remote resources.


Identifying and confirming the communication partner's availability and verifying the required resources to permit the specified type of communication to take place also occurs at the Application layer.
