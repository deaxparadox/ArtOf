# The Presentation Layer

The *Presentation layer* presents data to the Application layer and is responsible for data translation and code formatting.

By providing translation services, the Presentation layer ensures that data transferred from the Application layer of one system can be read by th Application layer of another one.

The OSI would include protocols that define how standard data should be formatted, so key functions like data compression, decompression, encryption, and decryption are also associated with this layer. Some  Presentation layer standards are involved in multimedia operations as well.
