# Types of Trees in Data Structures

----------

A Tree is a non-linear data structure and a hierarchy consisting of a collection of nodes such that each node of the tree stores a value and a list of references to other nodes (the "children").

----------

## 1. Binary Tree

*A binary Tree is defined as a Tree data structure with at most 2 children. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.*

Example:

Consider the tree below. Since each node of this tree has only 2 children, it can be said that this tree is a Binary Tree.

### Types of Binary Tree:

- Binary Tree consists of following types based on the number of children:

    1. Full Binary Tree
    2. Degenerate Binary Tree

- On the basis of completion of levels, the binary tree can be divided into following types:

    1. Complete Binary Tree
    2. Perfect Binary Tree
    3. Balanced Binary Tree


## 2. Ternary Tree

*A Ternary Tree is a data structure in which each node has at most three child nodes, usually distinguished as "left", "mid", and "right".

Example:

Consider the tree below. Since each node of this tree has only 3 children, it can be said that this tree is a Ternary Tree
