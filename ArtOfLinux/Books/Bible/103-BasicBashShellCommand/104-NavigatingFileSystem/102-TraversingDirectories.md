# Traversing directories

## change directory (cd)

You use the change directory command (cd) to move your shell session to another directory in the Linux filesystem.

The *cd* command syntax is pretty simplistic:  *cd destination*.

The *destination* parameter can be expressed using two different methods.

- One method is using an **absolute directory reference**.
- Another method is using an **relative directory reference**.
