# Using the shell prompt

- After you start a terminal emulation package or login in to a Linux virtual console, you get access to the shell CLI *prompt*. 
- The prompt is your gateway to the shell. This is the place where you enter shell commands.

## $ symbol

- The default prompt symbol for the bash shell is the dollar sign `$`. This symbol indicates thatthe shell is waiting for you to enter text. 

```bash
creator@paradox:~$ 
```

- besides acting as your access point to the shell, the prompt can provide additional helpfull information. 
- current user is *creator* and current pc name is *paradox*.
- colon *:* is a separator for name, and path, tidle `~` represent user home directory i.e. `/home/creator/` is equivalent to `~`, and finally `$` which prompt for command.
