# Comments


A comment is a piece of text that is part of a program but is completely ignored by the computer. JavaScript has two ways of writing comments.

## To write a single-line comment

```js
let accountBalance = calculateBalance(account);
// It's a green hollow where a river sings
accountBalance.adjust();
// Madly catching white tatters in the grass.
let report = new Report();
// Where the sun on the proud mountain rings:
addToReport(accountBalance, report);
// It's a little valley, foaming like light in a glass.
```

## To write a multi line comment

  I first found this number scrawled on the back of an old
  notebook. Since then, it has often dropped by, showing up in
  phone numbers and the serial numbers of products that I've
  bought. It obviously likes me, so I've decided to keep it.
