# Expressions and Statements

## Expression

- `A fragment of code that produces a value is called an *expression*`. Every value that is written literally (such as 22 or "psychoanalysis") is an expression. 
- An expression between parentheses is also an expression, as it a binary operator applied to two expressions or a unary operator applied to one.

The simplest kind of statement is an expression with a semicolon after it:

```js
1;
!false;
```
