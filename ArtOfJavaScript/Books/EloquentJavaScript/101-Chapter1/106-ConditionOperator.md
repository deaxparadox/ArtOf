# Conditional Operator

Conditiona (or ternary) operator, operates on three values. It is written with a question mark and a colon, like this:


```js
> console.log(true ? 1 : 2)
1
>
> console.log(false ? 1 : 2)
2
> 
```

The value on the left of the question mark "picks" which of the other two value will  come out. When it is true, it chooses the middle value, and when it is false, it chooses the value on the right.
