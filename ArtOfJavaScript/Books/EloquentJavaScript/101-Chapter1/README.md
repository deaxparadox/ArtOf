# Values, Types, and Operators


All this data in computer's world is stored as long sequences of bits and is thus fundamentally alike.

*Bits* are any kind of two-valued things, usually described as zeros and ones. Inside the computer, they take forms such a high or low electrical change. Any piece of discrete information can be reduced to a sequenc of zeros and ones and thus represented in bits.

Example: we can express the number 13 in bits.

```
   0    0    0    0    1    1    0    1
 128   64   32   16    8    4    2    1
```

So that's the binary number 00001101. Its non-zero digits stand for 8, 4, and 1 and add up up to 13.
